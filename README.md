Security Engineering Study Notes
These have largely been taken from, and adapted from Grace Nolans study notes (https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes). I want to thank her for making the repository public, and compiling an excellent starter guide.

I will be adding to each of the areas to expand on the topics covered, and explain them in a friendly manner. I hope to create some posters and flashcards on these topics too, which I will keep open source.
