Security Engineering Study Notes
These have largely been taken from, and adapted from Grace Nolans study notes (https://github.com/gracenolan/Notes). I want to thank her for making the repository public, and compiling an excellent starter guide.

I will be adding to each of the areas to expand on the topics covered, and explain them in a friendly manner. I hope to create some posters and flashcards on these topics too, which I will keep open source.

I am currently a Senior Cloud Security Consultant, where I design, build, and deploy SIEM and SOC solutions, mostly in Azure. I also provide security transformation workshops and SOC maturity consulting for clients. I am currently looking to develop my skills in coding and the more technical side of security engineering, and become more comfortable in working with code and larger code bases.

If this repo is useful and successful, I be looking to integrate it into the outreach work that I do with helping people transition into cyber, or landing their first job out of school, college, or university. I will also add lessons learned from our in house Graduates, Interns, and Apprenticeship program.

**If you are less confident at coding:** Spend more time writing small scripts and studying features of your preferred language. Coding is essential (even if you don't like it or you don't use it much in your current role). I have a section on coding in this list.

**If you are less confident at security topics:** I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.

**Improving coding skills takes a lot of practice**. Be sure to allow yourself enough time for it, including allowing time to be frustrated, to procrastinate, to iterate on your ideas, and to get help from others. Look for ways to make it fun or motivating - there are tedius repetitive tasks everywhere just waiting to be automated.
**It is completely normal and acceptable to interview again (many times, in fact!)**. Hiring managers love to see how someone has grown their skills over time.
If you are someone who didn't get an offer because you weren't confident in some areas, but you still believe that it would be a good role/company for you, take some time to build confidence in those areas and try again.
